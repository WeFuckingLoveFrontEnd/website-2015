                The first international conference of its kind to be held in Israel, will take place in Tel Aviv
                from June 8th through June 9th, 2015. To kick off the inaugural edition of this annual conference,
                the world’s top leaders in the field of front-end development will be among the featured
                guest speakers.

                <p class="has-section-spacing">
                    The two-day conference will bring together the best of the best in front-end development from
                    across the globe as well as from across Israel. For the first time, all of Israel’s front-end
                    developers, who are among the brightest, most tech-savvy this Start-Up Nation has to offer, will
                    all be in the same place at the same time. This conference – and its future editions – is a great
                    way for the international community and its leaders to get to know Israel’s rising front-end
                    development community and vice versa.

                <p class="has-section-spacing">
                    You Gotta Love Frontend will also provide a fun, energized atmosphere in which the field’s freshest
                    minds can share
                    their experiences, creative ideas and latest technologies – over pints of beer. With conference
                    participation expected to reach 700 attendees, like-minded developers will find an enriching
                    opportunity to interact with each other, learn from one another and establish a professional
                    network of communication.

                    The web was originally imagined to be a simple distributed document retrieval system.
                    It is now being used for applications that go far beyond the system's original capabilities and
                    intentions.
                    We have found ways to make it work, but they are difficult and far too fragile.<br/>
                    Many times companies have offered to replace the web with superior proprietary systems, but we
                    rejected them.
                    We have been adding features to the web, but this does little to correct the deep underlying
                    deficiencies,
                    increasing instead of reducing its complexity.<br/>
                    This talk suggests a way forward, taking inspiration from our successful transition from NTSC to
                    HDTV.
                    There is a way forward to a web that is safer, easier, and as good as we desire.

                    native developers have relied on since the inception of mobile platforms. Geolocation, sorted. Accelerometer, done.
                    Performance, we'll come back to that. But one of the greatest draws for native developers has been push notifications,
                    for the web, email alerts just don't cut it.
                    But now, new in browsers for 2015, is the Service Worker.
                    Born out of the struggle to make the Appcache work for offline capable sites it has also brought the advent of
                    push notifications to the web. Through building up an example application live we will see how to implement the
                    Service Worker to not only serve up an app when we're offline but enhance the online experience with push notifications.
                    The battle may continue, but the web is definitely pushing back.

                YGLF is a 2-day event. Days start at 8:30am with breakfast and a friendly gathering.
                Talk sessions last 30 minutes, except the longer keynotes and a few other surprises along the day :)<br /><br />
                Of course, a wealthy lunch, refreshing coffee breaks and quality beers are served throughout the day to make it extra fun!<br />

                It’s also bang in the middle of Tel Aviv, and accessible by public transportation.
