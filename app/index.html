                The first international conference of its kind to be held in Israel, will take place in Tel Aviv
                from June 8th through June 9th, 2015. To kick off the inaugural edition of this annual conference,
                the world’s top leaders in the field of front-end development will be among the featured
                guest speakers.

                <p class="has-section-spacing">
                    The two-day conference will bring together the best of the best in front-end development from
                    across the globe as well as from across Israel. For the first time, all of Israel’s front-end
                    developers, who are among the brightest, most tech-savvy this Start-Up Nation has to offer, will
                    all be in the same place at the same time. This conference – and its future editions – is a great
                    way for the international community and its leaders to get to know Israel’s rising front-end
                    development community and vice versa.

                <p class="has-section-spacing">
                    You Gotta Love Frontend will also provide a fun, energized atmosphere in which the field’s freshest
                    minds can share
                    their experiences, creative ideas and latest technologies – over pints of beer. With conference
                    participation expected to reach 700 attendees, like-minded developers will find an enriching
                    opportunity to interact with each other, learn from one another and establish a professional
                    network of communication.

                <p class="agenda-abstract">
                    The web was originally imagined to be a simple distributed document retrieval system.
                    It is now being used for applications that go far beyond the system's original capabilities and
                    intentions.
                    We have found ways to make it work, but they are difficult and far too fragile.<br/>
                    Many times companies have offered to replace the web with superior proprietary systems, but we
                    rejected them.
                    We have been adding features to the web, but this does little to correct the deep underlying
                    deficiencies,
                    increasing instead of reducing its complexity.<br/>
                    This talk suggests a way forward, taking inspiration from our successful transition from NTSC to
                    HDTV.
                    There is a way forward to a web that is safer, easier, and as good as we desire.

                    Think of the humble pie chart. Simple and ubiquitous,
                    yet surprisingly difficult to create with Web technologies in a flexible, maintainable way.
                    Faced with this simple goal, Lea will take you on a colorful interactive journey through
                    several aspects of CSS and SVG and will sweep you off your feet with clever ways to use them.
                    At the end, you will have your pie and animate it too, but do not be fooled:
                    the real takeaway of this talk has little to do with pie charts and a lot to do with problem
                    solving via the tools the Open Web Platform offers us today.

                    about asynchronous bridge that serves as communication channel between JavaScript and platform code

                <p class="agenda-abstract">
                    What would happen if we gave front-end developers the task of building a backend server that caters
                    to their needs? What would it do? What capabilities would it have? How would it be different from
                    the current backend servers, built by backend developers? I explore the possibilities and try to
                    envision
                    a future where the front-end developers are in charge of the servers that serve their own front-end
                    code.

                    io.js is a drop-in replacement for node.js and is compatible with nearly all the modules in npm.
                    io.js is a community driven open source project. It was started by the primary contributors to
                    node.js
                    but in the first few months attracted more active developers than the node.js project has had in its
                    entire history.
                    In this talk we'll explore the new features of io.js through how they were contributed by the
                    community.
                    We'll go through my actual contribution process (from issue to specification to pull request to
                    landing) of a feature and explore the new
                    and upcoming features of backend and frontend JavaScript through open source contribution and show
                    how to can get involved and why one should be involved.

                    else sooner or later will face with the same issues and most likely come to the idea of componentized web.
                    It's rather popular now and was even described as a W3C standard Web Components.
                    But how exactly new are the new ideas and how useful is its realization?
                    In the frontend world since Internet Explorer 5.5 a lot of developers know and use BEM methodology that was created
                    to solve exactly the same problems. During years of use it formed its own huge ecosystem that includes technologies,
                    tools, libraries and active community. It is built and developed by developers within Yandex and outside that use
                    it everywhere both in small such as promo page for a cat and high loaded projects such as Yandex services and Mail.ru.
                    They are well aware of the problems that developers face.

                <p class="agenda-abstract">
                    The battle between native and web rages on. The browsers are fighting hard to tear down the benefits that
                    native developers have relied on since the inception of mobile platforms. Geolocation, sorted. Accelerometer, done.
                    Performance, we'll come back to that. But one of the greatest draws for native developers has been push notifications,
                    for the web, email alerts just don't cut it.
                    But now, new in browsers for 2015, is the Service Worker.
                    Born out of the struggle to make the Appcache work for offline capable sites it has also brought the advent of
                    push notifications to the web. Through building up an example application live we will see how to implement the
                    Service Worker to not only serve up an app when we're offline but enhance the online experience with push notifications.
                    The battle may continue, but the web is definitely pushing back.

                <p class="agenda-abstract">
                    Recently browsers have been introduced with interesting tools for work with binary stream of
                    data. Technologies like XHR2 and File API allow us to fetch binary blobs from urls and the file
                    system, and from there, a whole new world is opened before us: we can use Media Source
                    Extensions to implement live streaming audio/video protocols like DASH and HLS, WebRTC to
                    transmit data P2P bittorrent style, WebGL to draw shapes from arrays of binary position data,
                    and more. Furthermore, using technologies like asm.js and tools like Emscripten to transpile
                    C++ code to JavaScript, we can do amazing things with all of the above, and achieve superior
                    performance. In this talk we'll explore some of these techniques, and learn about how we are
                    solving interesting problems with them.

                For the first year of YGLF, we chose to make the Cameri Theater our home.
                It has a really beautiful lobby, a sunny balcony, and a cool theatre hall to host our lectures.
                It’s also bang in the middle of Tel Aviv, and accessible by public transportation.
